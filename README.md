# CueBilt

CueBilt is a program that can take TSV-formatted cue sheet and build a skeleton cue list in QLab. Designers can build their cue sheets, download them as a TSV file, import them, and watch QLab magically make a group cue for each cue in their sheet. This takes the hassle and time out of the first steps to building a QLab workspace.
