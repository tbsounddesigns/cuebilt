## AppleScript files
These script files are called in the 'main.py' script to handle the commands and executions to QLab. If pulling a request or copying the repository, these scripts need to be converted from text-based **(.applescript)** files to binary files **(.scpt)** so that they compile and run properly. If you keep them as .applescript, they will not run.

They are simply kept in text-based formatting so that it is easier to edit them in a text-based editor of your choosing, or to peruse on GitHub. In practice, they need to be compiled as a binary.
